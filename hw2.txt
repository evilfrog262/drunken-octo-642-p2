FTP
1. username = shiningmoon
   password = public
2. In active FTP, the client connects to the server's command port (usually port 21) from an unprivileged port.  The client
	then listens on the next port, the original port + 1.  It issues a PORT command to the server and it waits for the 
	server to connect to this port from its data port (usually port 20).  This can be a problem because firewalls usually 
	don't allow an outside system to create a connection like this and might block this.
   In passive FTP, the client initiates both the connection to the command port and the connection to the data port.  The
	command port connection is made the same was as in active FTP, but instead of issuing a PORT command the client issues
	a PASV command.  The server then tells the client which unprivileged port it should make a connection with and the 
	client does this.
3.  There are no PORT requests from the client and therefore not active FTP connections.
4.  All of the requests are PASV and therefore passive FTP connections.
